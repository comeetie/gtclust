Description: gtclust offers two functions gtclust_poly and gtclust_graph that enable the clustering of spatial data such as polygons with a hclust type approach but taking advantages of contiguity constraints. The contiguities naturaly create a sparsely connected graph that can be leveraged to speed-up the calculations and deal with more than 30000 polygons in seconds.
